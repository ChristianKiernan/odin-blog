# Odin Blog - REST API
The back-end of a blogging REST API, implemented as a submission for the NodeJS course in the Odin Project (full-stack JavaScript track).

**Link to project:**
## Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – JavaScript runtime
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) – Web framework for Node.js
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) – Type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) – JSON Web Token-based authentication
- [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) – Authentication middleware
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) – Relational database
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) – Environment configuration
- [REST Client (VS Code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) – Local REST API testing

## Functionality
Users are required to register and then log in (JSON Web Token-based authentication). The API provides a backend that defines the HTTP methods GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE (on blog posts and comments).
## Lessons Learned
The main goals of this project were to implement a backend that adheres to RESTful standards, and to gain familiarity with coding clean API endpoints.
A couple things that I want to improve
upon in future projects;

* Overall understanding/integration of express - specifc middleware
* Developing a more streamlined scaffolding process
* Improved documentation
